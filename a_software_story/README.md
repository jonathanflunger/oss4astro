# Stella's Stellar Software Surprise

Stella, a young girl who loved stargazing, had an extraterrestrial encounter one clear 
night. A spaceship landed in her garden. From the spaceship a little squishy turquoise creature, in the 
shape of a shooting star emerged. 
It introduced itself as Luna, (aka Shepard) from Proxima Centauri b.


Shepard had a special task: to create software for astronomers. Stella eagerly 
agreed to help, using her creativity and love for the stars.

Together, they developed "StellaSky," a powerful tool for astronomers to explore
the cosmos. They shared it with their town and the world. The most beloved part of 
the software was the guessing game that users could play, where the software tried to 
guess the user's favourite star by asking a bunch of random questions. Due to Lumo's 
magic this worked everytime.

Stella's love for the stars, combined with Luna's (aka Shepard's) magical technical abilities, proved that even a 
young girl could make a big impact in astronomy. Stella's stellar software 
changed the way people saw the universe, lighting up the night sky for 
generations to come.
